# TodoProject

Very simple Kanban TODO project made in Angular with PrimeNG based on Trello.

Table is saved in cookies

Live demo at [todo.robi.zip](https://todo.robi.zip)

## Features
- Saving table locally
- Multiple lists and cards
- Drag and drop between lists
- Colorable cards

## Missing features
- Reorderable lists
- Better drag and drop support
  - Reorderable list
  - Preview (like in Trello)
  - Better visuals (Dragged element follows mouse)
- Better text color support
  - Currently the text is barely visible when the background color's value is around 0.5
- Better scroll bar
  - Scrollbar should be per list instead of the whole page 

## Considered ideas
- Multiple tables (should be easy to do)
- Custom background image (store base64 of image in cookies?)
- Export, import table(s)
- Advanced (optional) cards
  - Deadline support
  - TODO Check List with Progress Bar
